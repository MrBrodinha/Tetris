# Projeto CG - Computational Graphics Project

This computational graphics project was developed as part of a class by the following group members:

- Emanuel Pacheco (Me)
- Rodrigo Fonseca
- Vicente Ch√£
- Ricardo Pereira

The code is heavily based on an existing project found on GitHub, and the original creator can be credited here: [Original Creator's GitHub](https://github.com/andykhv/Tetris3D)

While the foundational code remains similar to the original project, our group has implemented several enhancements and modifications:

1. **Mouse-controlled Camera Movement (Rodrigo):**
   - Added the ability to control the camera using the mouse.

2. **Fragment Shader Changes (Rodrigo):**
   - Introduced alterations to the fragment shader for visual enhancements.

3. **Rotation Bug Fix (Emanuel):**
   - Fixed a bug where pieces could not rotate fully if positioned against the right wall.

4. **Continuous Movement (Emanuel):**
   - Implemented a feature that allows continuous movement of a piece by holding down the movement keys (left, down, right).

5. **Display of Future Pieces (Vicente):**
   - Adjusted the code to display the next four upcoming pieces instead of just one.

6. **Texture Color Modifications (Vicente):**
   - Made adjustments to the colors of the textures for visual diversity.

7. **Highscore System (Ricardo):**
   - Implemented a highscore system to track and display player achievements.

8. **Texture and Background Changes (Ricardo):**
   - Altered textures and background elements, allowing movement beyond the skybox boundaries.

Note: While we have made significant contributions to the project, the foundational code belongs to the original GitHub repository mentioned above.
